# Data-Structure-Visualizer
A modern, interactive web application designed to help users learn and explore fundamental data structures such as Stack, Linked List, and AVL Tree. The tool allows users to perform real-time operations—like insert, delete,
and search—while instantly visualizing the changes.

Each data structure includes a code reference section for deeper understanding.

Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project is ideal for students and educators looking to make data structures more accessible and engaging.
